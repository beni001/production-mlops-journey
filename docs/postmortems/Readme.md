# Postmortems

This directory contains **blameless postmortems** for all significant system failures, whether real or intentionally induced.

## When a Postmortem Is Required

- Silent failure discovered
- Data pipeline break
- Deployment rollback
- Drift detection event
- SLA violation
- Governance breach

If a failure occurs and no postmortem is written, the work is considered incomplete.

## Postmortem Philosophy

- Focus on systems, not people
- Assume the failure will happen again
- Design fixes, not patches

---

## Required Sections (Non-Negotiable)

Every postmortem must include:
1. Summary
2. Impact
3. Timeline
4. Root Cause
5. Detection Gaps
6. Corrective Actions
7. Prevention Measures
